### Back-end Technology (Spring Boot)
> Spring Boot framework provides a robust and scalable back-end infrastructure.
> It utilizes Spring MVC architecture for handling HTTP requests and responses efficiently.
> Implements RESTful principles for managing student data.

### Front-end Technology (Thymeleaf)
> Thymeleaf is used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
> Enables seamless integration of server-side templates with HTML, allowing for data presentation and manipulation.

## Database (MySQL)
> MySQL database stores and manages student information securely.
> Utilizes relational database capabilities to ensure data integrity and consistency.
> Supports efficient retrieval and storage of student records.

## Purpose
